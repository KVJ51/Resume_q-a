                            AI-Powered Interview Preparation System
The AI-Powered Interview Preparation System is a smart web-based platform designed to help students and job seekers prepare effectively for technical and HR interviews. Traditional interview preparation methods rely on human mentors and static question banks, which are often time-consuming and lack personalized feedback.
This system uses Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning techniques to simulate real interview environments, generate role-specific questions, analyze responses, and provide real-time feedback to improve candidate performance.

Objectives

To design an AI-based platform that conducts automated mock interviews.

To generate job-specific and resume-based interview questions.

To evaluate candidate responses using NLP and ML techniques.

To provide personalized feedback and performance analytics.

To improve confidence, communication skills, and interview success rate.

System Overview

The proposed system allows users to:

Register and upload their resume.

Select job role / domain (Software Developer, Data Scientist, etc.).

Attend AI-generated mock interview sessions.

Submit answers through text or voice.

Receive AI-based evaluation including technical knowledge, communication skills, and confidence score.
The system dynamically adapts the interview difficulty based on candidate performance to simulate real-world interview experience.

Feel free to contribute.
